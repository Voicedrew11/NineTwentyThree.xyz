<h1 id="radical-redesign">Radical Redesign</h1>
<p>Not long ago, I redesigned my entire website. I did away with my classic <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Y2K">Y2K</a> aestetic in favor of a more modern frosted glass look in conjunction with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_grail_(web_design)">holy grail layout</a>. At the time, I was extremly impressed with my work, and I would still agree that it was technically impressive. I have, however, decided to tear it down in favor of something more simple.</p>
<h2 id="iframes">Iframes</h2>
<p>One of my primary goals in my redesign was to have the entire page fit on a single viewport height; sort of like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">single page web app</a>. To pull this off, I made use of a central <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_iframe.asp">iframe</a> of restricted height that would have content loaded into it when hyperlinks in the navbar were clicked by the user.</p>
<p>One thing that sucks about this approach is that the experience of using the website varies significantly depending on the user&rsquo;s resolution. On a very small screen (~720p or less), elements in the sidebars would be forced off screen while the iframe in the center still maintained it&rsquo;s proper height.</p>
<p>You definitely can do iframes correctly, but I definitely did not. here are what I think are some (((better))) examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://purplehello98.neocities.org/main?z=/frame">PurpleHello98</a></li>
<li><a href="https://melonking.net/melon?z=%2Fhome">MelonKing</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Although, to push back on these two sites, they are both virtually unuseable in non-gui browsers (ie. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(web_browser)">Lynx</a>, <a href="https://w3m.sourceforge.net/">w3m</a>). To offer some conjecture, if your website can&rsquo;t reasonably be used in such a browser, it&rsquo;s probably too complicated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If it doesn’t work in Lynx, it doesn’t work at all.&rdquo; - <a href="https://starbreaker.org/blog/tech/personal-web-accessibility-march-2024/index.html">Starbreaker</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="javascript">JavaScript</h2>
<p>So like, I&rsquo;m not as autistic about JavaScript usage as some other people on the Personal Web™, but I definitely like to follow the philosophy of &ldquo;less is more&rdquo;. One of the great disadvantages of having an iframe dependent layout is that even quite basic functionality of your website becomes JavaScript dependent.</p>
<p>Lets say, for example, you wanted to link somebody to a blog post I had written. The process of doing this is already more complicated than normal, requiring you to right click on the frame and open it in a new tab. There is, however, an additional problem; On the page you&rsquo;ve just opened there is not background color; which means white text is being shown on a white background. What a mess!</p>
<p>The reason for this is that the page in question has to have a blank background so that when it is loaded into the iframe, it appears seamless.</p>
<p>But in this context, it&rsquo;s  all wrong, so to combat this I wrote a bit of JavaScript to detect if the page was being accessed from an iframe, and, if it was not, to change the background color to something sensible like gray.</p>
<p>Now, in my opinion, that is a pretty ingenious solution, somebody should definitely pay me for it, but it does raise some questions about the efficacy of the &ldquo;single page application&rdquo; I was going for. Have I not just created this problem for myself? A problem which did not previously exist? A problem which is only solved with JavaScript?</p>
<p>This was not an isolated problem either, for a second example, if I wanted the iframe to start with a particular page loaded (so that I may link somebody a page other than the default one), I would need to use JavaScript to read a tag in the URL and change the page loaded into the iframe.</p>
<h2 id="what-next">What next?</h2>
<p>Okay, so I&rsquo;ve explained the problems I had with my previous site, but what now? Is your new design not too radical in the other direction?</p>
<p>In some ways it definitely is. Besides the use of <a href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox">gruvbox</a>, there is very little character in the visuals of the site.</p>
<p>But for all the visual character I&rsquo;ve given up, I hope to replace it with substance. I&rsquo;d like to have more on my website that hyperlinks and images. I&rsquo;d like to put a lot more focus on writing. As such, I hope the design of my site somewhat reflects that.</p>
<p>Here are some sites I took queues from when designing my new site:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://risingthumb.xyz/">Risingthumb</a></li>
<li><a href="https://starbreaker.org/">Starbreaker</a></li>
<li><a href="https://commodorian.org/blog/index.html">Commodorian</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="plus-something">Plus Something</h2>
<p>You might be under the impression that I&rsquo;ve used an SSG to make my new site. truth be told, I just use a shell script to keep the navbar on each page the same. You&rsquo;ll never re-cuck me into using HUGO.</p>
